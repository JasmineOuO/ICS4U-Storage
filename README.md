# CritterSitter
An educational children's game on nutrition

CritterSitter is a fun game that teaches children about proper nutrition. Children learn about this nutrition by raising their own critter and feeding it healthy meals as well as visiting their doctor for check-ups and playing outside. The story starts of when you find a box of abandoned critters and decide to take them to the local vet. This vet, named Dr. Java, says that he will let the user keep the critter's if the user can successfully take care of one critter for 3-5 days. Now, you are on a mission to prove to Dr. Java that you are a worthy Critter Sitter! 

The objective of this game is to simply raise your critter until it has fully matured into an adult critter and gain the most points while keeping the critter healthy.
