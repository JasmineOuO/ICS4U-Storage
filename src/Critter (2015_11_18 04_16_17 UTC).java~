 * <b>colour</b> This String variable is used to store the critter's colour.
 * <p>
 * <b>critterState </b> This String variable is used to store the critter's state of either healthy (""), "Sick" or "Asleep".
 * <p>
 * <b>growthStage </b> This String variable is used to store the level of growth the critter is at currently of either "Baby", "Teen" or "Adult".
 * <p>
 * <b>isHealthy </b> This boolean variable is used to see if the critter is healthy or not.
 * <p>
 * <b>sickCounter </b> This int variable is used count up to 3 unhealthy meals until the critter gets sick.
